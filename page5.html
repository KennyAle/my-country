            <p class="content5-text">In the country of diversity, Adventure sports are not far behind. Each of the four
                worlds that make up Ecuador (Pacific Coast, Andes, Amazon and Galapagos) has a way of releasing
                adrenaline in our body: either by climbing rocky walls, furrowing at high speed the torrential rivers
                that descend into the jungle , surfing in the waves of the Coast and diving in Galápagos, there is an
                ideal activity for every adventurer.</p>
            <p class="content5-text">All these experiences can be lived almost at the same time, because Ecuador
                combines thousands of
                fascinating scenarios in a small space.</p>
            <h2 class="content5-subtitle">Paragliding</h2>
            <p class="content5-text">Ecuador is a great destination to do this activity because of the diversity of the
                landscapes that can be observed. Whether on the South Pacific Coast or in the diverse Andean scenarios
                that combine lakes and mountains, every minute in the air will stay in your memory forever.
